                <p className='p-3'>Modular construction using recylced shipping containers is becoming an increasingly popular alternative to conventionally built structures. Modular units offer consumers numerous benefits over their traditional stick-framed counterparts: cost savings, eco-friendliness, and a distinctive aesthetic appearance. In 2022, modular construction is a great option for shipping container restaurants, diners, and other commercial applications. By choosing to house your business within a modular unit, you can complete your build faster while equipping yourself with a modern, comfortable, and fully customized facility. Décor and interior design play a large role in how your restaurant is perceived, and the type of crowd it attracts. While BMarko’s modular construction process gives you plenty of options for creating comfortable, conventional spaces both inside and out, many clients find the industrial look of a repurposed shipping container to be one of its key selling points. Choose a modular restaurant to give your eatery the edge it needs in a fiercely competitive culinary landscape. Modular restaurant construction gives you free reign to design the best kitchen area and front-of-house for your team. Rather than forcing you to use a set floor plan, BMarko’s modular restaurant designs are flexible and modifiable in plenty of convenient ways. Shipping container restaurants are also easy to expand when you need to accommodate future growth. Simply stack a modular addition on top of your existing structure or add a couple on to the side for several hundred extra square feet. It’s an easy and cost-effective way to provide new customers and staff with a comfortable space while minimizing construction time on site.</p>
